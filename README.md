# oop344-finalProject-AssemblyLine

This is my final assignment in my OOP344 course. A C++ program using object-oriented programming principles that simulate an assembly line. Assembly line stations and items are read from a text file. The program iterates through the stations and shows the progress of each item until all items are assembled.
